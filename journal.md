# June 8th: Did some research on ordered parts

I had a version of this project on the backburner last year, and It came to a grinding halt as I had no budget and I realized the parts I had didn't fit my goal.
Since then the entire project has been lost somewhere on an old hard drive (probably in my shed), and I thought that now would be a great time to pick it back up!

Today, I didn't start too much with engineering, instead I look and found some pieces online which I believe at this moment will fit my purpose.


A 20kg 0.10s/60deg servo
 - I have some old 10kg servos but they struggled a lot on the old version of this project, so I'm bumping up. These are also ridiculously cheap for some reason
A N20 500rpm geared motor
 - My last motors were standard TT gearbox motors, and I think these are a good step up in speed and handling
A 6V 2000mAh rechargeable battery pack
 - I'll be damned if I do one more project with individual cells instead of a battery pack. Given the specs of everything else I'm using: Arduino mega, 3 servos, 3 motors, this should last around two to four hours; Otherwise known as great mileage.
 
At the moment no photos because they are all still online, however this research did take me some time. 
It is very preliminary so things probably will change

**Total time spent: 2h**
